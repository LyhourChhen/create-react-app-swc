## FAQ

### Why is it faster?

Internally create-react-app use babel to compile the javascript / typescript files of your application. By using craco-swc, you use the [swc](https://swc.rs/) compiler to compile your app instead of babel. swc is a super fast javascript / typescript compiler written in Rust.

### What is craco and why do I need it?

[craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) (**C**reate **R**eact **A**pp **C**onfiguration **O**verride) is an easy and comprehensible configuration layer for create-react-app. By using craco you can customise the create-react-app configuration without ejecting.
